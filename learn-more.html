     As technology becomes more critical in our environment, so has its demand. 
     Technology corporations have created a massive growth in electronic waste by making sure their products last a few weeks before

    <h2>
      Climate change
    </h2>
      <p>
        Scientific evidence for warming of the climate system is unequivocal.
- Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
</p>
      <p>
        Climate change effects animals, agriculture and the human population.
        Over time climate change will reshape the face of our planet and while
        some amount of climate change is natural, there's a more than 95 percent
        probability that human activities over the past 50 years have warmed our
        planet. Currently, climate change has caused glaciers to shrink, ice on rivers and lakes to break up earlier, 
        plant and animal ranges to shift and trees to flower sooner. For more information on the evidence, causes, 
        effects and solutions of global climate change visit<a id="link" href="https://climate.nasa.gov/">This Website</a>

    <h2>
      CO2 Emissions
     </h2>
    <p>
      Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere are called greenhouse gases. CO2 is the secound 
      most abundent greenhouse gas behind water vapor. Carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere through
      burning fossil fuels like coal, natural gas, and oil.
      It also enters the atmosphere as a result of certain chemical reactions.
      Greenhouse gases cause the Earth to warm, which will eventually change our climate altoghether.
      A changing climate has a range of potential ecological, physical and health impacts, including 
      extreme weather events, sea-level rise, 
      altered crop growth, and disrupted water systems.
     </p>
     <p>
       Pro-tip: One way you can cut down on your CO2 emissions is to buy energy and water efficient appliances!
