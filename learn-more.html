        Climate change effects animals, agriculture and the human population.
        Over time climate change will reshape the face of our planet and while
        some amount of climate change is natural, there's a more than 95 percent
        probability that human activities over the past 50 years have warmed our
        planet. Currently, climate change has caused glaciers to shrink, ice on rivers and lakes to break up earlier, 
        plant and animal ranges to shift and trees to flower sooner. For more information on the evidence, causes,

      Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere are called greenhouse gases. CO2 is the secound 
      most abundent greenhouse gas behind water vapor. Carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere through
      burning fossil fuels like coal, natural gas, and oil.
      It also enters the atmosphere as a result of certain chemical reactions.
      Greenhouse gases cause the Earth to warm, which will eventually change our climate altoghether.
      A changing climate has a range of potential ecological, physical and health impacts, including 
      extreme weather events, sea-level rise, 
      altered crop growth, and disrupted water systems.

       Pro-tip: One way you can cut down on your CO2 emissions is to buy energy and water efficient appliances!

        Ocean pollution is the spreading of harmful substances such as oil, plastic, 
        industrial and agricultural waste and chemical particles into the ocean. 
        This waste has caused devastating effects on marine life. It is the responsibility of every citizen to 
        play his or her part in making these oceans clean so that marine species can thrive for a long period of time.
        Most of the debris in the ocean does not decompose and remain in the ocean for years. These debries cause oxygen levels to go
        down as they decompose. Low oxygen levels are dangerous to marine life. Some other dangers to our ocean include: 
        sewage, toxic chemicals from industries, land runoff, large scale oil spills, and ocean mining.

        Pro-tip: You can help save the ocean by cutting down on single use plastics!

        As technology becomes more critical in our environment, so has its demand. 
        Technology corporations have created a massive growth in electronic waste by making sure their products last a few years before creating new products to keep up with the industry.
        The high cost of repairing the product also tends to spark more replacing the old with the new one at a cheaper rate.
        Electronics contain valuable elements like gold and silver, yet they also contain toxic materials as well.
        Many of the materials and elements in electronics can be recycled and help prevent the destruction of many animal habitats.
        Recycling these parts may help reduce the 20 to 50 million metric tons of e-waste that are disposed of worldwide every year.

      Deforestation is the clearing or thinning of forests by humans. This large issue completly 
        destroys forests.  In some cases, however, even partial logging and accidental fires 
        thin out the trees enough to change the forest structure dramatically.The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates 
        that the annual rate of deforestation is about 1.3 million square km per decade, though keep in mind that rate has since slowed thanks to enviormental
        protections. The tropics are the most high-risk because of slash-and burn-agriculture. Our forests must be protected as they contain most of the planetâ€™s 
        valuable biodiversity and although forests may regrow after 
        being cleared and then abandoned, this is not always the case, especially if the remaining forests are highly fragmented.
         </p>
    
      <p>
        Pro-tip: Time to go digital, one good way to help stop deforestation is to cut down on paper!
